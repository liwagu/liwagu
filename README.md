# Liwa

Hello, I'm Liwa. Welcome to my personal page!

## About Me

As an individual backend developer, I bring a wealth of experience and a diverse skill set to the table. My proficiency in Java and Golang, coupled with my hands-on experience in relational databases like MySQL and NoSQL technologies such as Redis, has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of backend development.

I have a deep understanding of microservices architecture, with practical knowledge of SpringCloud, its core components, and other RPC frameworks like Dubbo. I have honed my skills in backend development middleware, mastering the use of message queues, cache, and search engines.

With two enriching backend internships under my belt, I have a proven track record of tackling complex technical challenges. My ability to swiftly identify and resolve issues, coupled with my knack for developing high-performance applications, sets me apart in the field of backend development.

Whether working in a team or as an individual contributor, I thrive in all environments, bringing a blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a passion for backend development.
